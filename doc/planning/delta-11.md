# Delta 11 — State file

**Goal:** state survives restart; active space restored on launch.

- [ ] `StateStore` with Combine publisher for `activeSpace`
- [ ] Loads/saves `~/Library/Application Support/tilr/state.toml`
- [ ] Hotkey fire → `StateStore.setActive(name)` persists & publishes
- [ ] Never writes to user `config.toml`
- [ ] `tilr status` reports `activeSpace`; new CLI command `tilr switch <name>`

**Notes:**
