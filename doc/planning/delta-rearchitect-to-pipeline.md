# Delta: Rearchitect to Pipeline

**Status: PLANNING**

Refactor Tilr's core architecture to the **Input → Plan → Execute → Record** pipeline model defined in `doc/arch/tilr-arch-v2.md`. This eliminates redundant state diffing, preserves command intent through all phases, and makes state a trailing record of what AX actually achieved (crucial for Zen hide and other AX quirks).

## Design decisions for Milestone 1

- **App enumeration**: Track all running apps via `NSRunningApplication`. Filter criteria can be refined in later milestones if needed.
- **Active state tracking**: Parent container tracks active child state (fractal pattern). Displays track which space is active; spaces track which apps are visible. Each object is responsible for its own active-child tracking.
- **Display identity**: Use existing `DisplayStateStore` UUID→ID mapping (hardware-level CGDisplay UUIDs persisted in `~/.local/share/tilr/display-state.json`, with numeric IDs in config). StateInitializer calls `DisplayStateStore.resolveId()` for each connected display.
- **CLI state access**: Client/server arrangement only. `tilr state view` queries the running app via socket; if app not running, fail gracefully. All-in-memory state (no persistence yet; that's Milestone 2).
- **State storage**: `StateCoordinator` actor holds mutable state and immutable history. No singletons. Injected explicitly into collaborators (SocketServer, CommandHandler, pipeline phases). `TilrStateSnapshot` (Sendable value type) used for read paths and cross-process communication.
- **State mutations**: Via `StateCoordinator.record(plan:, outcomes:)` — creates new snapshot from execution outcomes, appends to immutable history. Record phase bridges Execute phase outcomes to state evolution. Audit trail of all state changes with timestamps and reasons.

The pipeline has three core phases:
1. **Plan**: Translate input (Command or Event) + current state → ExecutionPlan (what actions to take)
2. **Execute**: Run the plan, collect outcomes (succeeded/failed/timeout for each action)
3. **Record**: `StateCoordinator.record(plan:, outcomes:)` — create immutable snapshot from outcomes, append to history (state mirrors what AX confirmed, not what was predicted)

## Milestone 1: App Startup & State Initialization + Observability

**Goal:** Get the app to start up, initialize TilrState from config, and expose it via a CLI command for inspection.

### What we're building

1. **TilrState initialization** (app startup) — read displays, load space config, initialize state
2. **State persistence** — store state to disk after each successful execution (allows recovery on crash)
3. **CLI observability** — `tilr state view` displays state as a tree (displays → spaces → apps)
4. **JSON export** — `tilr state export` for scripting / testing

### State storage architecture (StateCoordinator actor)

State is owned by a `StateCoordinator` actor, held by AppDelegate as the single root reference. Explicit injection into collaborators (no singletons).

- **Thread-safe by design** — `actor` type prevents data races on concurrent access (socket reads, future pipeline mutations)
- **Immutable history** — Each state change recorded as `TilrStateSnapshot` (Sendable value type) appended to history. Audit trail with timestamps and reasons.
- **Record phase** — `StateCoordinator.record(plan:, outcomes:)` evolves state from execution outcomes (not predictions), creates snapshot, appends to history.
- **Future-proof for mutations** — Pipeline phases call `await coordinator.record(...)` atomically; undo/redo becomes possible from history.

### Architecture pieces involved

- `StateCoordinator` — actor owning mutable state and immutable history; held by AppDelegate
- `TilrState` struct (already defined in arch doc) representing displays, spaces, and apps
- `TilrStateSnapshot` — Sendable value type for read-only consumers (CLI, socket responses, formatters)
- `StateInitializer` — loads config + enumerates displays via NSScreen + running apps, builds initial state
- `StateFormatter` — renders state as human-readable tree for the CLI
- New CLI subcommand: `tilr state` with `view` and `export` actions

### Implementation sequence

1. **Define Swift types for TilrState and snapshots** (`Sources/Shared/TilrState.swift`):
   - `struct TilrState` — mutable current state (displays, spaces, apps, active children)
   - `struct Display`, `struct Space`, `struct App` — domain model
   - `enum AppDisplayState { case visible, case hidden }`
   - `struct TilrStateSnapshot: Sendable` — immutable value snapshot (includes id, timestamp, reason, previous state, plan, outcomes)
   - `struct ActionOutcome` — execution result (success/failed/timeout) with error details

2. **Create StateInitializer** (`Sources/Shared/StateInitializer.swift`):
   - `func initializeState() -> TilrState`
   - Enumerate displays via NSScreen (using existing DisplayResolver)
   - Resolve display IDs using `DisplayStateStore.resolveId()` — Tilr already maintains stable UUID→ID mappings persisted in `~/.local/share/tilr/display-state.json` from hardware CGDisplay UUIDs (vendor/model/serial). New displays auto-assign the next available numeric ID.
   - Load space definitions from config
   - Track all running apps (enumerate via NSRunningApplication)
   - Return initial TilrState

3. **Create StatePersistence** (`Sources/Shared/StatePersistence.swift`):
   - `func saveState(_ state: TilrState)` — writes to `~/Library/Application Support/tilr/state.toml`
   - `func loadState() -> TilrState?` — reads from disk; returns nil if not found
   - Use TOML (existing dependency) for serialization

4. **Create StateFormatter** (`Sources/Shared/StateFormatter.swift`):
   - `func formatAsTree(_ state: TilrState) -> String` — renders state as ASCII tree
   - Example output:
     ```
     TilrState
     ├─ Display "Built-in" (id: display-1) [active space: Coding]
     │  ├─ Space "Coding" [ACTIVE]
     │  │  ├─ App "com.apple.dt.Xcode" (VISIBLE)
     │  │  └─ App "com.microsoft.VSCode" (VISIBLE)
     │  └─ Space "Reference"
     │     └─ App "com.zen-browser.zen" (HIDDEN)
     └─ Display "LG UltraFine" (id: display-2) [active space: Scratch]
        ├─ Space "Scratch" [ACTIVE]
        │  └─ App "com.agilebits.onepassword7" (VISIBLE)
        └─ Space "Schedule"
           └─ App "com.google.Calendar" (HIDDEN)
     ```
   - `func formatAsJSON(_ state: TilrState) -> String` — JSON serialization for export

5. **Create StateCoordinator actor** (`Sources/Shared/StateCoordinator.swift`):
   - `actor StateCoordinator`
   - `private var history: [TilrStateSnapshot]`
   - `func snapshot() -> TilrStateSnapshot` — current state as Sendable snapshot
   - `func history(limit: Int) -> [TilrStateSnapshot]` — recent snapshots for audit trail
   - `func record(plan:, outcomes:)` — Record phase: evolve state from outcomes, create snapshot, append to history

6. **Wire app startup** (`Sources/Tilr/AppDelegate.swift`):
   - Create `StateCoordinator` instance in `applicationDidFinishLaunching`
   - Call `StateInitializer.initializeState()` to build initial state
   - Create first snapshot and pass to coordinator
   - Store coordinator as property on AppDelegate (the single root reference)
   - Inject coordinator into SocketServer, CommandHandler
   - Log the initialized state

7. **Add CLI `state` subcommand** (`Sources/TilrCLI/TilrCLI.swift`):
   - New subcommand `state` with actions: `view`, `export`
   - `tilr state view` — queries running app via socket for current snapshot, formats as tree, prints to stdout
   - `tilr state export` — same but outputs JSON
   - Both communicate with the running app via socket protocol (coordinator responds with `await snapshot()`)
   - Fail gracefully if app is not running

8. **Update Protocol** (`Sources/Shared/Protocol.swift`):
   - Add `TilrStateRequest` / `TilrStateResponse` to the IPC protocol
   - Response contains `TilrStateSnapshot` (the Sendable value type)
   - SocketServer deserializes request, awaits `coordinator.snapshot()`, serializes response

### Files to create

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Sources/Shared/TilrState.swift` | Core domain types: TilrState, Display, Space, App, AppDisplayState, TilrStateSnapshot (Sendable), ActionOutcome |
| `Sources/Shared/StateInitializer.swift` | Reads config and enumerates displays/apps to build initial state |
| `Sources/Shared/StateCoordinator.swift` | Actor owning mutable state and immutable history; exposes `snapshot()` and `record(plan:, outcomes:)` |
| `Sources/Shared/StateFormatter.swift` | Renders state as ASCII tree or JSON |

### Files to modify

| Path | Change |
|---|---|
| `Sources/Shared/Protocol.swift` | Add `TilrStateRequest` and `TilrStateResponse` messages (response contains `TilrStateSnapshot`) |
| `Sources/Tilr/AppDelegate.swift` | Create `StateCoordinator` on startup. Call `StateInitializer.initializeState()`, create first snapshot, store coordinator as property. Inject into SocketServer and CommandHandler. |
| `Sources/Tilr/SocketServer.swift` | Accept coordinator reference. On `TilrStateRequest`, await `coordinator.snapshot()` and respond with snapshot. |
| `Sources/TilrCLI/TilrCLI.swift` | Add `state` subcommand with `view` and `export` actions. Query running app via socket for snapshot. |

### Acceptance criteria

- **App startup initializes state** from config + displays without crashing, creates `StateCoordinator`, creates initial snapshot
- **`tilr state view`** queries running app via socket, receives snapshot, displays as tree (at least 3 levels: Display → Space → App with visibility and active-child tracking)
- **`tilr state export`** outputs valid JSON of snapshot that can be parsed
- **State includes at least**: Display names/IDs, Space names, running App bundle IDs, visibility states, active child tracking (which space is active per display, which apps are visible per space)
- **Snapshot includes metadata**: id (UUID), timestamp, reason (why state changed), plan (what was attempted), outcomes (what happened)
- **Logging shows state initialization** on app startup (`[state] Initialized TilrState with 2 displays, 5 spaces, 12 running apps`)
- **No state diffing in the code** — only initialization and snapshot formatting. Pipeline phases (Plan, Execute, Record) come in later deltas.
- **CLI fails gracefully** if app is not running (clear error message, not a crash)

### Notes / non-goals

- Not yet executing commands or updating state (that's the next delta: `Input → Plan`)
- Not persisting state to disk yet (that comes after we have a working pipeline)
- Not handling space switching or app hide/show (that requires the full pipeline)
- CLI state commands read from the running app; they don't mutate state

## Appendix: Design Decision — Parent Tracking vs Child State

### Decision: Parents track active/visible child state

`Display` owns `activeSpaceId: String?` (which space is active on this display).
`Space` owns `visibleAppIds: Set<String>` (which apps are visible in this space).
Children (`Space`, `App`) do not track their own active/visible status; they expose computed helpers for convenience.

### Rationale

**Data integrity:** With parent tracking, "exactly one active space per display" is encoded in the type system. Child-tracked state (`space.isActive: Bool` on each space) permits invalid states: zero, two, or N active spaces have no compile-time or runtime guard. Validation becomes an unbounded scan of all children.

**Atomicity:** Switching active space is one atomic write (`activeSpaceId = newId`). With child tracking, flipping two children's `isActive` flags between those writes leaves state inconsistent. Swift value types lessen the race-condition risk, but the *modeling* still permits transient invalidity.

**Record phase mutations:** When the pipeline's Execute phase returns outcomes, the Record phase updates state. Example: "Plan said activate space X; Execute returned failure — space Y is still active." 

With parent tracking: `display.activeSpaceId = outcome.actualActiveSpaceId` (one assignment).

With child tracking: loop all spaces, set each's `isActive` flag. On partial failures (e.g., 3 of 4 apps hid successfully), spreading one semantic fact across N children risks a missed update.

**Fractal structure:** This approach correctly repeats the pattern: at every level, the *parent* owns "which children are foregrounded." That's the relational structure of the fractal pattern. Child-tracked flags repeat a primitive, losing the hierarchy.

**Serialization:** Parent-tracked IPC is more compact and unambiguous (`"activeSpaceId": "uuid-123"` vs N boolean flags). Malformed snapshots can't represent invalid states (e.g., two active spaces on the wire).

### Ergonomics

Callers needing to ask "is this app visible?" can use computed helpers:
```swift
extension Space {
    func isVisible(_ app: App) -> Bool { visibleAppIds.contains(app.id) }
}
extension Display {
    var activeSpace: Space? { spaces.first { $0.id == activeSpaceId } }
}
```

The canonical store is parent-owned; derived views are read-only projections for convenience.
